While some may define it differently, we at shanarishonah.com feel that a menu plan is a guideline you use to make preparing supper an easy and smooth experience.
Almost every wife can remember the days where grocery trips were a daily occurrence and what to make for supper was the question that took up the most brain space.
But as time goes on and life gets busier, you may not have the time (or patience) to spend on this simple question. Enter Menu Planning. Sit down and write yourself a plan of what you would like to serve each day. Don't write specifics - just the general food category you want to serve. (See sample menu plans below). After that you have two ways to go about it. You can either write up a 4 week rotation, choosing specific meals for each day. Once a month is generally far apart enough that you shouldn't get bored of anything to quickly! You can update the plan every so often (we like to do it when the seasons change) to keep things interesting. Choosing this option completely removes any need for questions or decisions when it comes to supper. Of course, as humans, you may have one day where the schedule says to make something you just can't stomach! Never fear - we won't tell anyone if you don't stick to the plan exactly! The goal is to have a plan so you have a point of reference. You can always change and add as you go along.
The second option is to keep your guide and choose what to make each day at the beginning of the week. This allows for more spontaneity, but also is a bit more time consuming than the first option. Choose the path that's right for you and let's get planning!
