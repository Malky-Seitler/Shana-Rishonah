            <HomePageTitleType>It started as a dream...</HomePageTitleType>
            <div style={{ fontSize: 24, marginBottom: 24 }}>
              We were so excited to be married. But we were unprepared for those
              long evenings when we're all dressed up with nowhere to go, or
              those date-day dilemmas when we can't decide where to head out, or
              those times when we're just itching for some fun but can't figure
              out what to do. We were tired of spending hours searching for
              ideas online. And we knew our friends were too. And then we
              thought - what if we can all join together to create a list of
              ideas for each other...
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <HomePageTitleType>And so, the idea was born...</HomePageTitleType>
            <div style={{ fontSize: 24, marginBottom: 24 }}>
              What if there was a centralized place to get ideas? What if the
              next time we were itching for a night out, we could just click and
              voila â€“ ideas galore, right at our fingertips! What if we could
              swap ideas with friends? What if we could all help each other out?
              And so, ShanaRishonah.com was born. We poured our hearts,
              countless hours of detective work, and a sprinkle of fairy dust
              into crafting a place where ideas can be shared and memories can
              be made...
